Here is your license for Imageflow.

Ignore this e-mail if you have already installed your key; you do not need to update your license manually.


For Imageflow.NET Server:
Please install this license into your Startup.cs file, then visit /imageflow.license in your application to confirm license status. If your license is invalid, you may see red dots appear in the corner of processed images.
You can alternately use EnforceLicenseWith.Http422Error to have image requests fail instead of watermarking them.
====================================
app.UseImageflow(new ImageflowMiddlewareOptions()
  .SetLicenseKey(EnforceLicenseWith.RedDotWatermark, "<%= @id_license_body %>")
====================================

This is a network license key. It is validated hourly via a HTTPS GET request; this request may eventually also securely transmit telemetry about the product (like server and core count, domains, plugins, and response times). When this telemetry is added, we will expose an API for seeing exactly what is transmitted.

Validation results are cached and can be used until expiry if is a network disruption. There is also a grace period in case no cached result is available.

All information that is transmitted with license validation can be seen at /imageflow.debug.
