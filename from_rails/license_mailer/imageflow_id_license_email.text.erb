Here is your license for Imageflow. 

Imageflow does not yet support registering your license key, but will within a few weeks. Please contact support@imazen.io if you need help with installing your license.

Ignore this e-mail if you have already installed your key; you do not need to update your license manually.

====================================
/v1/licenses/add
{ "id_license": "<%= @id_license_body %>" }
====================================

This is a network license key. It is validated hourly via a HTTPS GET request; this request may eventually also securely transmit telemetry about the product (like server and core count, domains, plugins, and response times). When this telemetry is added, we will expose an API for seeing exactly what is transmitted.

Validation results are cached and can be used until expiry if is a network disruption. There is also a grace period in case no cached result is available. 


Decoded placeholder license (for informational purposes)
====================================
<%= @id_license_text %>

Your initial (decoded) remote license (updated when you renew or change your subscription)
====================================
<%= @remote_license_text %>
