Validation results are cached and can be used until expiry if is a network disruption. There is also a grace period in case no cached result is available. 

All information that is transmitted with license validation can be seen at /resizer.debug. 

If you are not using Web.config, you can install the license via code.

      @"<%= @id_license_body %>");
